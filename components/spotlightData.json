With the war over, its infamous hero Hitokiri Battousai disappeared into thin air, leaving only his legend behind.\n\nYears later, a seemingly plain wanderer named Kenshin Himura encounters Kaoru Kamiya, the owner of a struggling local dojo in Tokyo. Kaoru pursues a self-proclaimed Battousai who roams the streets, indiscriminately killing citizens and police officers. Furthermore, the warrior professes to use the Kamiya Kasshin-ryu—a sword style developed by Kaoru's father deeply rooted in the essence of life, not death.\n\nKenshin decides to help Kaoru take down the impostor and restore her father's dojo. Unbeknownst to all, Kenshin is none other than the real warrior whose name still terrifies the people. Although Kaoru eventually learns the truth, his oath to atone for his murderous history by bloodlessly protecting the weak moves her, and she welcomes Kenshin to stay at her dojo. However, Kenshin's ideals are soon challenged by ghosts of the past and enemies of the present.","poster":"https://img.flawlessfiles.com/_r/1366x768/100/04/56/0456cafffaea918e8ea0d0ca74e2d71c/0456cafffaea918e8ea0d0ca74e2d71c.jpg","jname":"Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan (2023)","episodes":{"sub":24,"dub":11},"otherInfo":["TV","22m","Jul 7, 2023","HD"]},{"rank":2,"id":"bleach-thousandyear-blood-war-the-separation-18420","name":"Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War - The Separation","description":"After a brutal surprise attack by the forces of Quincy King Yhwach, the resident Reapers of the Soul Society lick their wounds and mourn their losses.
